        <h2>What do I do in my free time</h2>
        <img id="fonne" src="images/logo.png" width= 100px alt="">
        <p>Most of my free time goes to organizing a festival, <a href="https://www.fonnefeesten.be" target="_blank">Fonnefeesten</a>.<br>
        I am a board member and responsible for the finacial follow-up.<br>
        Fonnefeesten is a 10 day free festival at the same moment of the Lokerse Feesten.<br>
        When I am not spending my time for the Fonnefeesten, I play games. <br>
        I play boardgames and computer games. I loke racing and strategy games.<br>
        When it is Formula 1 I try to follow the raceweekend, but you can find more information about this on the <a href="formula1.html">following page</a>.<br>
        According to this, some karting with friends is always fun and a nice beer after the session makes it complete.</p>

        <h2>Why the switch?</h2>
        <p>When I had to make the choice of what I was going to study, there were two options</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Social Work</li>
        <li>IT</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you have read above, I made the choice to study socail work.<br>
        After a few years, I realized it would have been better to study IT. <br>
        A that moment I started my eduction in evening school, as programmer.<br>
        With 1 more year to go, the opportuninty of SwitchFully came along. <br>
        There was no doubt and I took my chance. And now I am looking forward to meet you all and start the program in september.</p>
        <div class="greeting"><p>Until then,<br>
